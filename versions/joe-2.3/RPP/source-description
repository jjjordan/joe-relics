JOE stands for Joe's Own Editor.  It is a professionaly done ASCII editor.
Here is the first paragraph from the man page...  It does a good simple
explanation of why you should try JOE...

       JOE  is my ASCII-text screen editor.  It has a "mode-less"
       user interface which is similer to many  user-friendly  PC
       editors. Users   of  Micro-Pro's  WordStar  or   Borland's
       "Turbo" languages will feel at home.  JOE is a  full  fea
       tured UNIX screen-editor though, and has many features for
       editing programs and text.
