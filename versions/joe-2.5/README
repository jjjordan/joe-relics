This is Joe's Own Editor.  See the INFO file if you don't know what this is.

A preformatted man page is in joe.man.  Joe.1 is an nroff formatted man
page.

Installation proceedure
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Edit the Makefile to change the following options:

	  Where joe's keymap initialization files will
	  go if not /usr/local/lib.

	  Where joe will be placed when you do 'make install'
	  if not /usr/local/bin.

	  Where joe's man page will be placed, if not /usr/man/man1.

	  If you want to use the terminfo database instead of termcap.

	  Some systems require a few other changes (notably Xenix).  Check
	  out the comments in the Makefile.

	Type 'make' to create joe.  You can then try it by typing ./joe.

	Then type 'make install' to install joe.

	Type 'make clean' eliminate the .o files

	Copy termcap to .termcap in your home directory if you want to
	use it instead of /etc/termcap (see below).

	Set the baud rate properly (see below).

USEAGE:	joe filenames

	Optionally preceed each filename with +nnn to start at specified 
line number.  

  Options:

 -mid		Cursor is recentered when scrolling is necessary
 -marking	Text between ^KB and cursor is highlighted (use with -lightoff)
 -asis		Characters 128 - 255 shown as-is
 -force		Force final newline when files are saved
 -nobackups	If you don't want backup files to be created
 -lightoff	Turn off highlighting after block copy or move
 -exask		^KX always confirms file name
 -beep		Beep on errors and when cursor goes past extremes
 -nosta		Disable top-most status line
 -keepup	%k and %c status line escape sequences updated frequently
 -pg nnn	No. lines to keep for PgUp/PgDn
 -csmode	^KF after a pervious search does a ^L instead
 -backpath path Directory to store backup files
 -nonotice	Disable copyright notice
 -noxon		Attempt to turn off ^S/^Q processing
 -orphan	Put extra files given on command line in orphaned buffers
		instead of in windows
 -dopadding	Output pad characters (for when there is no tty handshaking)
 -lines nnn	Set no. screen lines
 -baud nnn	Set baud rate for terminal optimizations
 -columns nnn	Set no. screen columns
 -help		Start with help on
 -skiptop nnn	Don't use top nnn lines of the screen


  Options before each file name:

 -wordwrap		Wordwrap
 -autoindent		Auto indent
 -overwrite		Overtype mode
 -lmargin nnn		Left margin
 -rmargin nnn		Right margin
 -tab nnn		Tab width
 -indentc nnn		Indentation character (32 for space, 9 for tab)
 -istep nnn		Number of indentation columns
 -french		One space after '.', '?' and '!' for wordwrap
			and paragraph reformat instead of two.  Joe
			does not change the spacing you give, but
			sometimes it must put spacing in itself.  This
			selects how much is inserted.
 -spaces		TAB inserts spaces instead of tabs.
 -linums		Enable line numbers on each line
 -rdonly		File is read-only

	These options can also be set in the joerc file.  The NOXON, LINES,
COLUMNS, DOPADDING and BAUD options can also be set with environment
variables.

	The JOETERM environment variable can be set to override the TERM
environment variable.

** IMPORTANT **

The baud rate must be correctly set or either typeahead will not interrupt 
the screen update and scrolling wont be used or there will be annoying 
delays in the screen update.  If you can't set the baud rate correctly with 
'stty', give a numeric value in the environment variable 'BAUD' or to the
command line options '-baud'.

The baud rate '38400' or 'extb' means infinite to joe.  Use it for X windows
and hardware console ttys.  No delays will be generated and scrolling will
not be used.

Use the LINES and COLUMNS environment variables or the -lines and -columns
command line options if you need the terminal size to be different than
whatever the termcap entry or stty reports.

Since most people use terminal emulators, JOE does not send out pad 
characters.  If you're using a real terminal and the padding matters, set 
the environment variable DOPADDING or give the command line option
-dopadding.

If you want joe to try to disable ^S/^Q processing, set the environment
variable NOXON or command line option -noxon.

A termcap file is included with JOE.  You might consider updating your own 
termcap file with the entries in it, particularly if you use ANSI/VT100ish 
terminals.  JOE understands some capabilities which are not usually supplied 
in normal termcap (see below).

                                 VARIATIONS
                                 =-=-=-=-=-

Termcap/Terminfo
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

	JOE prefers to use the termcap terminal capability database.  You
have if the file '/etc/termcap' exists.  If it doesn't you can use the
'termcap' file supplied with joe by copying it to /etc.

	Termcap is better than terminfo because it is a more open standard. 
Programs can directly access the termcap database and future versions of
terminfo may require programs to use curses.  The only argument in
terminfo's favour is that it is faster than termcap.  To fix this problem,
JOE will use a termcap index file if it exists and if it is up to date.

	This is the proceedure to make the termcap index file:

		make termidx
		./termidx </etc/termcap >/etc/termcap.idx

	The /etc/termcap.idx is a text file which you can look at if you're
curious.

	JOE supports the GNU extensions to the termcap language and also
understands several new capabilities:

		AL DL IC DC RI LE UP DO SF SR

			Versions of the standard capabilities which accept
			an argument.  For example, RI with and argument of
			7 should move the cursor 7 positions to the right.

		rr

			Set this flag if the cursor is restricted to move
			only within the scrolling regions.  This is an optional
			mode on vt220s and several clones assume that this
			mode is always on.

		cV

			Like the 'cv' capability, but the cursor goes to the
			beginning of the specified line.  Like 'ESC [ n H' in
			ansi/vt100.

	But if you really must use the terminfo database see the
instructions in the Makefile.

VOID trouble
=-=-=-=-=-=-

	If you're using an old C compiler which doesn't like the 'void'
type, uncomment the '#define void int' line from the config.h file.
