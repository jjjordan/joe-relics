should use temporary buffers instead of memory blocks for
undo, cut, s&r.  Will be faster and eliminate malloc
problem on small machines (with undo: use a single buffer?)

maybe there should be a cut block to buffer function which does no
copying except at the ends...

at least undo records should be eliminated when a large block is requested

msdos-

 how to get it to recognize CR-LF? - use translating fopen?

 msdos doesn't have 'sys/dir.h' does it?  yuck...

 how to give memory back during shell escapes?

 how to give memory back to dos during shell escapes

hexadecimal edit mode / fixed record length edit mode

rectangular blocks

block restricted searches

background loading / shell windows

goto line with error

tag search

verticle windows  		- difficult to get scrolling to work right

xedit folding stuff		- regex too slow?

multiple line prompts/menu windows

block coalescing in b.c.
can you insert/delete given the b->eof pointer? etc..
  begining of line detector in insert/delete won't work right with multiple
  insert/deletes seperated by quick movement functions
  - might be ok... just don't do that...

store number of lines in block headers, maybe could improve search speed

insert and delete should determine number of columns so that fixup doesn't
have to call pfcol so much.
