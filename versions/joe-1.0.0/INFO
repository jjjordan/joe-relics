I apologize to all those people who I promised that joe would be done
real-soon-now.  I knew that it only take me a few weeks to finish it, but I
could never seem to get down to it... things like work school and
procrastination kept interfering...  2000 lines of JOE took a year and a
half and the remaining 18000 took the last month. 

This release is kind of a beta test of the rewrite.  Not everything I
promised to implement is done yet, but most things are.

These are the new features:

	TERMCAP/TERMINFO support

		Joe will now work on any termcap terminal (except for
overstrike terminals).  A new termcap library is supplied which can use an
index file to make it faster than terminfo.  A number of terminfo extensions
are supported and the GNU extensions to the termcap language are supported.
JOE is not picky about the completeness of the termcap entries.  It should
work even better than vi in this respect.

	Improved scrolling

		Necessary scrolling is detected at a lower level in the
editor.  All edit commands will scroll if they need to.

	Better UNIX integration

		Every place in joe which accepts a file name (including the
command line) will also accept:

		!command		to pipe into or out of a command
		>>filename		to append to a file
		filename,start,size	to edit a portion of a file/device
		-			to use stdin or stdout

		Also, filenames on the command line may be preceeded by +nnn
to start editing at a specified line.

	Improved orthoganality

		Each prompt is actually a normal edit buffer and a copy of a
history buffer.  You can use all of the normal edit commands to edit the
file names and search strings.  You can use the up arrow key (and search
backwards or any other normal edit command) to get back previous responses.

	New buffering system

		Joe now uses a doubly linked list of gap buffers which can
spill into /tmp directory files.  You can edit files of any size up to the
amount of free disk space and there are no line length restrictions.

	16-bit system support

		This is not quite done, but joe was written so that it will
eventually work well on xenix 286 and msdos.

	File name selection menus

		If you hit tab in a file name prompt, a menu of matching
names will appear.

	New help system

		When you ask for help, you get a menu of help screens to
choose from (all definable in the .joerc file).  Also in certain places
the help is context sensitive.

	The edit commands are improved:

		- search and replace system uses powerful regular expressions
		  including matching of balanced C expressions

		- undo and redo now apply to complete edit commands.  If you
		  accidently reformat paragraph on your C code, you only
		  have to hit undo once.

		- a position history is supplied so you can to next/prev. place

		- multiple keyboard macros can be defined

	Many options are supplied:

		row and column numbers can be shown on status line
		emacs style cursor recentering on scrolls
		characters between 160-254 can be shown as-is
		Ctrl and Meta chars can be displayed in joe or emacs style
		Final newline can be forced on end of file
		Can start with help on
		No. pgup/pgdn lines to keep can be specified
		Left margin as well as right margin can be specified

	Joe will soon have:

		Hex dump edit mode
		Fixed record length edit mode
		Rectangular blocks
		Tag search and goto line with error
		and maybe xedit style folding commands
