/* void ttopen(void);  Open the tty (attached to stdin) for use inside of JOE
 *
 * (0) Call sigjoe()
 *     There is also 'void ttopnn(void)' which does not do this step.
 *
 * (1) fflush(stdout)
 *
 * (2) Save the current state of the tty
 *
 * (3) Disable CR/LF/NL input translations,
 *     Disable all output processing,
 *     Disable echo and line editing, and
 *     Place tty in character at a time mode.
 *     (basically, disable all processing except for XON/XOFF if it's set)
 *
 * (4) Set this new tty state without loosing any typeahead
 *
 * (5) Store the baud rate in the global variable 'baud'
 *
 * (6) Divide the baud rate into the constant DIVIDEND and store the result
 *     in the global variable 'upc'.  This should come out to the number
 *     of microseconds needed to send each character.  The constant 'DIVIDEND'
 *     should be chosen so that 'upc' reflects the real throughput of the
 *     tty, not the theoretical best throughput.
 *
 * (7) Create an output buffer of a size which depends on 'upc' and the
 *     constant 'TIMES'.  'TIMES' is the number of times per second JOE
 *     should check for typeahead.  Since we only check for typehead after
 *     the output buffer is flushed, 'upc' and the size of the output buffer
 *     determine how often this occurs.  So for example if 'upc'==1000 (~9600
 *     baud) and 'TIMES'==3, the output buffer size is set to 333 characters.
 *     Each time this buffer is completely flushed, 1/3 of a second will go by.

 * (1) write() any character in the output buffer to the tty.  Sleep for the
 *     amount of time it should take for all of these characters to get
 *     to the tty.  This is so that any buffering between the editor and the
 *     tty is defeated.  If this is not done, the screen update will not be
 *     able to defer for typeahead.
 *
 *     The best way to do this (and it's currently only possible in BSD) is to
 *     set a timer for the necessary amount, write the characters to the tty,
 *     and then sleep until the timer expires.
 *
 *     If this can't be done, it's usually ok to 'write' and then to sleep for
 *     the necessary amount of time.  However, you will notice delays in the
 *     screen update if the 'write' actually takes any significant amount of
 *     time to execute (it usually takes none since all it usually does is
 *     write to an operating system buffer).
 *
 * (2) If the global variable 'leave' is not set and if the global variable
 *     'have' is not set, check for typeahead.  If there is any, set the global
 *     variable 'have'.  This absolutely must not read any characters from the
 *     'tty' if 'leave' is set or typeahead will be lost when the editor exits
 *     or does a shell escape.
