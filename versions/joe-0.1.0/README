If you don't know what this is, read the NEWS file.

To compile:

	(1) Determine where you want to install the editor program and the
	    system default keymap file.  Put this path in the Makefile.  If
	    you're a mere user, don't worry about this.  Instead, place a copy
	    of the '.joerc' file in your home directory. 

	(2) If you need to be able to display characters with bit 7 set as-
	    is (instead of in inverse), comment out the '#define NOHIGHBIT'
	    line in the file 'joe.h'

	(3) type 'make xenix' for Xenix systems, 'make hpux' for HPUX systems
	    or 'make bsd' for BSD systems.  If none of these work, type
	    'make cruddy' to make a version with an inferior terminal driver.

	(4) To install it in the system, log in as superuser and do
	    'make install'

	(5) When JOE is used, be sure the baud rate as reported by stty is correctly
	    set.  If you're not on a real serial terminal, try to set the baud
	    rate to the best guess of what the actual throughput is.  In particular,
	    if you use JOE on a windowing system, the window updates will be much
	    faster if you set the baud rate to 'extb' or '38400'.
