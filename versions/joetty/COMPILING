Compile 3 files along with your own code.  The three files are:

	scrn.c		The main JOETTY program

	termcap.c	The termcap interface

	and one of the tty*.c files.  Choose one of the following:

	ttybsd.c	For BSD UNIX
	ttysv.c		For AT&T SYS V UNIX
	ttyhpux.c	For AT&T SYS V UNIX with BSD extensions
	ttymsdos.c	For MS-DOS (TURBO - C, any memory model)
	ttyposix.c	For POSIX (I haven't tested this)
	ttyxenix.c	For Xenix (be sure to link in the 'x' library)
	ttybad.c	If nothing else works

If your computer is pedantic about declarations (I.E., if it gives errors;
many compilers will give warnings), try to change: 

	typedef int V;

to

	typedef void V;

in the types.h file.

For MS-DOS, be sure to copy 'termcap' to \etc\termcap
also, put 'set TERM=ansisys' in the autoexec.bat file
and be sure to use ANSI.SYS
