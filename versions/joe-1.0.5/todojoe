should use temporary edit buffers instead of memory blocks for
undo, cut, s&r.  Will be faster and eliminate malloc
problem on small machines (with undo: use a single buffer?)

maybe there should be a cut block to buffer function which does no
copying except at the ends...

at least undo records should be eliminated when a large block is requested

store number of lines in block headers, maybe could then use faster search

insert and delete should determine number of columns so that fixup doesn't
have to call pfcol so much.
