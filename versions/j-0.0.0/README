If you don't know what this is, read the NEWS file.

To compile:

	(1) Determine where you want to install the editor program and the
	    system default keymap file.  Put this path in the Makefile.  If
	    you're a mere user, don't worry about this.  Instead, place a copy
	    of the 'keymap.j' file (created after you make) in your home
	    directory. 

	(2) type 'make xenix' for xenix systems, 'make hpux' for hpux systems
	    or 'make bsd' for BSD systems.  If none of these work, type
	    'make cruddy' to make a version with an inferior terminal driver.

	(3) To install it in the system, log in as superuser and do
	    'make install'
