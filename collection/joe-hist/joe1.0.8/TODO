BUGS
=-=-

=-=-=
sync problems with SIGCHLD/wait

=-=-=
problem with save?

NEW FEATURES
=-=-=-=-=-=-

=-=-=
background/demand loading

=-=-=
hexadecimal edit mode

=-=-=
fixed record length edit mode

=-=-=
block restricted search option

=-=-=
key bindings which depend on file type

=-=-=
verticle windows  		- difficult to get scrolling to work right

=-=-=
xedit and folding stuff		- regex too slow?

=-=-=
multiple line prompts/menu windows

=-=-=
key layout:
  delete to beginning of line	?
  search backwards		?
  yank/unyank			?/?

PORTABILITY
=-=-=-=-=-=

=-=-=
msdos-

 how to get it to recognize CR-LF? - use translating fopen?

 how to give memory back during shell escapes?

=-=-=
make identifier length significant in first 8 (6?) places for old C compilers

PERFORMACE
=-=-=-=-=-

=-=-=
should use temporary edit buffers instead of memory blocks for
undo, cut, s&r.  Will be faster and eliminate malloc
problem on small machines

maybe there should be a cut block to buffer function which does no
copying except at the ends...

at least undo records should be eliminated when a large block is requested

=-=-=
block coalescing in b.c.

=-=-=
store number of lines in block headers, maybe could then use faster search
algorithm

=-=-=
insert and delete should determine number of columns so that fixup doesn't
have to call pfcol so much.

=-=-=
maybe have special access function which automatically fix col only when col
is accessed
