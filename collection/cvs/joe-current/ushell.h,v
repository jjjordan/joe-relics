@Thu Jul  8 2004  Joe Allen <jhallen@@world.std.com>

	Merge last two changes (described below...)


Tue Jul  6 2004  Pavel Fedin <sonimiga@@rambler.ru>

     Changed some fork()s to vfork()s.
	Added ^# (CSI = 0x9B) control character.
	Added Amiga CSI sequences to keys definitions in joerc files.
	Added some #ifdef's to compile properly on AmigaOS.

Tue Jun 22 2004  Joe Allen <jhallen@@world.std.com>

	~/.joe_state file.

	Saves macros, yanks records, and file name history in a file.

@Compile now uses shell window (so you can hit ^C during the
compile).

Shell window termination code fix: now all of the output always
makes it to the window.

Added query save loop to save all modified files before build.

Added scratch buffers: they are ignored during ^K X, ^C and
querysave.

^X ^C in jmacs is now much more like emacs.
