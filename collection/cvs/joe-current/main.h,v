@        Reformat mouse.c

        Apply diff patch

        Apply vpath patch

        Apply electrum's mouse patch (send mouse off code during
        shell escape)

        Mouse can now resize windows

        Mouse can position cursor in menus.  Double-click selects
        an item.  Need to add scroll.

@	Added -notite global option: when set, prevents screen from
	being restored on exit.

	Added -usetabs global option: when set, uses tabs for cursor
	position update (which was the default before).  Now we don't
	use tabs by default.

        Completed change to 'unsigned char *' and elimination of
        MAXINT.  What a mess.  No warnings with gcc -pedantic.

	Fix UTF-8 bugs where cursor was not correct on scrolled screen.
