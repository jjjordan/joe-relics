@xterm-patch should be applied to xterm-200, which can be found at:

http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html


With this patch, the following escape sequences become available, and you
can enable "-joexterm" in the joerc file:

	ESC [ ? 2 0 0 4 h	Enable bracketed pastes.

	ESC [ ? 2 0 0 4 l	Disable bracketed pastes.

		When bracketed pastes are enabled, paste
		data looks like this:

			ESC [ 2 0 0 ~ <paste-text> ESC [ 2 0 1 ~

	ESC [ ? P		Send base64 encoded paste data to program
				(when JOE gets middle button click, it sends
				this to xterm to make it send the paste
				data).

	ESC [ ? 2 P		Accept base64 encoded paste data until ESC.
				This data becomes the "selected text" which
				can be pasted by other applications.

	ESC [ ? 2 0 0 7 h	Enable outside of frame mouse coordinates.

	ESC [ ? 2 0 0 7 l	Disable outside of frame mouse coordinates.

		When outside of frame mouse coordinates are enabled, and
		xterm mouse support is enabled (ESC [ ? 1 0 0 2 h), mouse
		coordinates are sent even if they are outside of xterm's
		window frame.

		The coordinate code bytes should be interpreted like this
		(we need negative coordinates in case mouse is above or to
		left of window):

			Code			Coordinate
			----			----------
			33 - 240		1 - 208  (normal)
			32			0	 (left/top of frame)
			241 - 255		-15 - -1 (left/top of frame)

		(When this mode is off, codes 33 - 255 correspond to
		coordinates 1 - 223).

Also, this patch makes XTerms compiled with wide character support much faster.

Also, this patch makes XTerm stores UTF-8 data in the server's cut buffer,
instead of latin1.
