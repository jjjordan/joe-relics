@1. Introduction
---------------
This file describes particular issues on AmigaOS port of JOE.

2. Requirements
---------------
To compile JOE you need ncurses and termcap libraries installed.

3. Installation
---------------
- Extract the archive into your GeekGadgets tree
- Go to AmigaOS shell and execute "setenv TERM amiga"
- Copy file ENV:TERM to your ENVARC: directory.

4. Usage
--------
Unfortunately ixemul.library does not implement pseudo-terminals (ptys), so
inserting shell command output (CTRL-K !) does not work. All other functions
are fully implemented and work exactly in the same way as in UNIX version.

5. Compiling
------------
To recompile JOE just cd to the directory with sources and type (if you use
standard Amiga shell):

	sh configure --prefix=/gg

From UNIX shell (like ksh) you may just type:

	./configure --prefix=/gg

When the configuration process finishes, type:

	make

After compiling you may install the program by using:

	make install

To clean up the distribution (erase all binary and #?.o files) you can use:

	make clean

6. Known bugs
-------------
AmigaOS port of JOE currently has no specific bugs
