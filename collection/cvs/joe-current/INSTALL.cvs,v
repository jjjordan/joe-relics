@You can downlaod sources of the JOE editor by various ways. One of them is
CVS. You have to have cvs package installed to properly access the CVS
server. CVS package can be downloaded from http://www.cvshome.org/.

Downloading of joe sources via CVS can be done by issuing following command:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@@joe-editor.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/joe-editor co joe-current

To reduce bandwidth and needless updates, the CVS repository does not
contain automatically-generated files, even when those files are normally
present in the distribution tarballs.

Therefore, if you're building from the CVS sources, you'll need to have GNU
autoconf and GNU automake installed on your machine (these do the afore
mentioned automatic generation). These packages are available from
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/<package>/> and its mirrors (please choose one
close to you), listed at <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>.

!!! Important note !!!
Versions of autoconf and automake used by maintainers and confirmed to do
the right thing are:

	automake version >= 1.8.4
	autoconf version >= 2.59

Failing to use above mentioned version may cause malfunction of building
system or even malfunction of joe itself.

In case you aren't used to running autoconf manually to generate the
necessary configure script, here are necessary steps:

	cd directory_with_sources
	./autojoe

Now you can build joe as you are used to with the downloaded .tar.gz
package, ie.:

	./configure
	make
	make install
