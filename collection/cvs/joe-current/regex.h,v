@	Added -notite global option: when set, prevents screen from
	being restored on exit.

	Added -usetabs global option: when set, uses tabs for cursor
	position update (which was the default before).  Now we don't
	use tabs by default.

        Completed change to 'unsigned char *' and elimination of
        MAXINT.  What a mess.  No warnings with gcc -pedantic.

	Fix UTF-8 bugs where cursor was not correct on scrolled screen.
