<p>JOE is a full featured terminal-based screen editor which is distributed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  JOE has been around since 1988
and comes standard with many Linux distributions.</p>

<p>JOE is being maintained by its original author Joseph Allen, plus all of
the people who send bug reports, feature suggestions and patches to the
project web site.  JOE is hosted by SourceForge.net and its source code is
controlled under CVS.  Over the last few years there has been about one
major new release a year, usually in the April-May timeframe.</p>

<p>JOE is a blending of MicroPro's venerable microcomputer word processor
WordStar and Richard Stallman's famous LISP based text editor GNU-EMACS (but
it does not use code from either program): most of the basic editing keys
are the same as in WordStar as is the overall feel of the editor.  JOE also
has some of the key bindings and many of the powerful features of EMACS.</p>

<p>JOE is written in C and its only dependency is libc.  This makes JOE very
easy to build (just "configure" and "make install"), making it feasible to
include on small systems and recovery disks.  The compiled binary is about
300K in x86.  Note that JOE can use either the termcap or terminfo terminal
capabilities databases (or a built-in termcap entry for ANSI terminals).  The
choice is controlled by a "configure" option.  If terminfo is used, a
library is required to access the database (on some systems this library is
ncurses, but JOE does not use curses to control the terminal- it has its own
code for this).</p>

<p>Much of the look and feel of JOE is determined by its simple
configuration file "joerc".  Several variants of the editor are installed by
default in addition to "joe": "jmacs" (emulate GNU-EMACS), "jstar" emulate
WordStar, "jpico" emulate the Pine mailer editor PICO and "rjoe"- a
restricted version of JOE which allows the used to only edit the file given
on the command line.  JOE is linked to several names.  The name which is
used to invoke the editor with "rc" tacked on the end gives the name of
configuration file to use.  It is thus easy for you to make your own variant
if you want.  Also you can customize the editor by copying the system
"joerc" file to your home directory.</p>

<p>Here is a basic screen shot of JOE running in a Cygwin console:</p>
<img src="capture.gif" alt="screen capture">

<p>Here is a screen shot showing several windows- the first has some example
double-wide characters, the second is the same buffer as the first, but in
hex-dump view mode, the third is a shell window and the fourth shows a
selected rectangular block of numbers and their sum:</p>

<img src="elaborate.gif" alt="elaborate screen capture">

<p>JOE has the following features:</p>
<ul>

<li>Multi-file search and replace- file list is either given on command line
or by a UNIX command (grep/find) run from within JOE.</li>

<li>Mouse support, including wheel (works best when using xterm).  The mouse
can resize windows, scroll windows, select and paste text, and select menu
entries.</li>

<li>Context display on status line: allows you to see name of function
cursor is in.</li>

<li>UTF-8 support, optional auto-detect of UTF-8 files.</li>

<li>Syntax highlighting for more than 40 languages.</li>

<li>Hexadecimal edit mode.  Use JOE as a disk editor: joe -overwrite -hex
/dev/hda1,0,512 (edit first sector of /dev/hda1).</li>

<li>Non-destructive editing of binary files even when handling MS-DOS or
UNIX line endings.</li>

<li>Swap file allows editing files larger than memory.</li>

<li>Context sensitive on-line help.</li>

<li>Bash-like TAB completion and history for all prompts, or jump into the
completion menu and use it to traverse the file system.</li>

<li>Complete word in edit buffer by hitting ESC Enter (uses other words in
buffer for dictionary).</li>

<li>EMACS-compatible file locks and file modification checking.</li>

<li>Shell windows.</li>

<li>Multiple-windows onto same or different files.</li>

<li>Compile and step through errors or Grep and step through finds.</li>

<li>Goto matching character delimiter ( [ { &lt; which skips comments and
quoted matter.</li>

<li>Goto matching word delimiter, including XML tags and C preprocessor
directives.</li>

<li>Ctrl-arrow key block selection.</li>

<li>Search and replace system, including regular expression and optional
incremental search.  Regular expression key for matching balanced C
expressions.</li>

<li>Tags file search (tab completion at tags search prompt uses tags file as
database).</li>

<li>Spell check commands which invoke aspell or ispell.  Language for aspell
can be passed through editor.</li>

<li>Paragraph format which preserves news/mail quoting indentation
characters.</li>

<li>Unlimited Undo and Redo.</li>

<li>Yank buffer allows stepping through and insertion of previously deleted
text.</li>

<li>State file restores history buffers, yank buffer and last file cursor
positions.</li>

<li>Cursor position history allows you to step through previously visited areas
of a file.</li>

<li>Multiple interactive keyboard macros.  Macros can be assigned to key
sequences in joerc file.</li>

<li>Block move/copy/delete/filter.</li>

<li>Rectangle (columnar) block mode- search and replace can be narrowed to
the rectangular block.  Rectangular blocks can be filtered through UNIX
commands.</li>

<li>Overtype/Insert modes.</li>

<li>Indent/Unindent (shift block left or right).</li>

<li>Auto-indent mode.</li>

<li>Picture mode for ASCII graphics.</li>

<li>Line number mode displays line number of each line.</li>

<li>Powerful scientific calculator with block statistics functions
(sum/standard-deviation/count highlighted block of numbers).</li>

<li>Termcap/Terminfo support allows JOE to use any terminal or terminal
emulator.</li>

<li>Can accept data from a pipe, for example: ls | joe</li>
</ul>

<p>JOE does not have these features (yet):</p>
<ul>

<li>Vertical windows, but JOE will probably have this in version 3.6</li>

<li>Folding</li>

<li>Right to left editing for Hebrew and Arabic</li>

<li>Direct editing of 16-bit character sets such as UCS-16 and BIG5</li>

<li>All encompassing macro language like elisp in GNU-EMACS</li>

<li>Background spell checking, like Microsoft WORD</li>

<li>Highlight all matching words</li>

<li>Automatic unzip/untar</li>

<li>Built-in FTP</li>

<li>X-Window version (use inside a terminal emulator)</li>

<li>Native Windows version (but you can use JOE in Cygwin)</li>

<li>Interface to debugger</li>

<p>http://sourceforge.net/projects/joe-editor</p>

<p>If you have questions, problems or suggestions, 
Use sourceforge: mailing list, bug tracker, discussion groups.</p>

<p>JOE is the professional freeware ASCII text screen editor for UNIX. 
It makes full use of the power and versatility of UNIX, but lacks the steep
learning curve and basic nonsense you have to deal with in every other UNIX
editor. JOE has the feel of most IBM PC text editors: The key-sequences are
reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo-C.  JOE is much more powerful than those
editors, however.  JOE has all of the features a UNIX user should expect:
full use of termcap/terminfo, excellent screen update optimizations (JOE is
fully usable at 2400 baud), simple installation, and all of the
UNIX-integration features of VI.</p>

<p>JOE's initialization file determines much of JOE's personality and
the name of the initialization file is simply the name of the editor
executable followed by "rc".  JOE comes with four "rc" files in addition to
the basic "joerc", which allow it to emulate these editors:</p>

<ul>
<li>JPICO</li>
<p>An enhanced version of the Pine mailer system's PICO editor.</p>

<li>JSTAR</li>
<p>A complete imitation of WordStar including many "JOE" extensions.</p>

<li>RJOE</li>
<p>A restricted version of JOE which allowed you to edit 
only the files specified on the command line.</p>

<li>JMACS</li>
<p>A GNU-EMACS imitation which is about one order of magnitude smaller than real
GNU-EMACS.</p>
</ul>

<p>Features:</p>
d43 1
a43 90
<p>JOE has a well thought-out user-interface with great attention to
detail.  The Page Up and Page Down functions do not move the cursor relative
to the edges of the screen.  Left and Right arrow keys work at the beginning
and ends of lines.  The cursor can move past the ends of lines without
jumping, but also without inserting or deleting extra spaces at the ends of
lines. Control characters and characters above 127 can be displayed and
entered- even ^Q and ^S.  The cursor's row and column number can be
displayed in the status line.</p>

<p>The key layout is made to reduce terminal incompatibility nonsense. 
^Q and ^S are not used and both ^H and DEL are mapped to backspace.  Case
does not matter in key sequences- ^K E, ^K e, and ^K ^E are each mapped to
the same function.  The arrow keys and PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Insert
and Delete keypad keys are read from the termcap entry and are assigned to
the proper functions.  A simple initialization file, similar to Semware's
Q-EDIT, allows key-bindings, simple macros and help windows to be
defined.</p>

<p>JOE has full termcap/terminfo support and will work on any terminal. 
JOE has the best screen update optimization algorithm available.  It uses
VT100-style scrolling regions the way they are supposed to be used (I.E.,
without building insert and delete line functions out of them) and has a
powerful line shifting (insert/delete character) algorithm which works even
if text goes past the ends of lines.  JOE has deferred screen update to
handle typeahead and uses the baud rate reported by 'stty' to ensure that
deferral is not bypassed by tty buffering.</p>

<p>JOE has multiple windows and lacks the confusing notion of a named
buffers.  You just have files and windows.  When there are more windows than
can fit on the screen, the Goto-Next-Window function scrolls through them. 
The same file can have multiple windows opened on it.</p>

<p>JOE has VI-style unix integration.  You can filter a highlighted
block through a UNIX command.  Also, each place in joe which accepts a file
name (including the command line) will also accept:</p>

<ul>
<li>!command</li>
<p>to pipe into or out of a command</p>
<li>&gt;&gt;filename</li>
<p>to append to a file</p>
<li>filename,start,size</li>
<p>to edit a portion of a file/device</p>
<li>-</li>
<p>to use stdin or stdout</p>
</ul>

<p>File names on the command line may be preceded by +nnn to start
editing at a specified line.</p>

<p>JOE has shell windows.  You can run a shell in a window and any
output from commands run in the shell gets stored in a buffer.</p>

<p>JOE has an orthogonal event-driven design.  Each prompt is actually
a normal edit buffer containing a history of all of the responses entered
for that prompt.  You can use all of the normal edit commands to create file
names and search strings.  You can use the up arrow key (or search backwards
and any other appropriate edit command) to go back through the history of
previous responses.  Prompts are reentrant- meaning that edit commands which
require prompts can still be used inside of prompts.</p>

<p>JOE has TAB-completion and file selection menus.  If you hit tab in
a file name prompt, the name is either completed or a menu of possible
matches appears.</p>

<p>JOE stores edit files in a doubly linked list of gap buffers which
can spill into a temporary file.  You can edit files of any size up to the
amount of free disk space and there are no line-length restrictions.  Since
the buffering system is block-based, JOE will incur only a minimum of
swapping on heavily loaded systems.</p>

<p>When you ask for help, one of six small help reference cards appears
on the screen and remains while you continue to use the editor.  Here is the
first help card:</p>

<p>
<pre>
CURSOR           GO TO            BLOCK      DELETE   MISC         EXIT
^B left ^F right ^U  prev. screen ^KB begin  ^D char. ^KJ reformat ^KX save
^P up   ^N down  ^V  next screen  ^KK end    ^Y line  ^T  options  ^C  abort
^Z previous word ^A  beg. of line ^KM move   ^W &gt;word ^@@  insert   ^KZ shell
^X next word     ^E  end of line  ^KC copy   ^O word&lt; ^R  retype   FILE
SEARCH           ^KU top of file  ^KW file   ^J &gt;line SPELL        ^KE new
^KF find text    ^KV end of file  ^KY delete ^_ undo  ^[N word     ^KR insert
^L  find next    ^KL to line No.  ^K/ filter ^^ redo  ^[L file     ^KD save
</pre>
</p>

<p>JOE has a powerful set of editing commands suitable for editing both
text files and programs:</p>
d45 1
d47 1
d50 22
a71 15
<li>search and replace system, including powerful regular expressions (including matching of balanced C
expressions).</li>
<li>tags file search</li>
<li>paragraph format</li>
<li>undo and redo</li>
<li>position history allows you to get back to previous
editing contexts and allows you to quickly flip between
editing contexts</li>
<li>multiple keyboard macros</li>
<li>block move/copy/delete/filter</li>
<li>rectangle (columnar) mode</li>
<li>overtype/insert modes</li>
<li>indent/unindent</li>
<li>goto matching ( [ {</li>
<li>auto-indent mode</li>
d73 2

<p>Plus many options can be set:</p>
d76 11
a86 8
<li>can have EMACS-style cursor re-centering on scrolls</li>
<li>characters between 128-255 can be shown as-is for non-English character
sets</li>
<li>Final newline can be forced on end of file</li>
<li>Can start with a help screen on</li>
<li>Left/Right margin settings</li>
<li>Tab width</li>
