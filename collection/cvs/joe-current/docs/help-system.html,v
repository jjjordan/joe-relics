		<p>
			Differences between this and previous version should be hidden
			to users. Main changes were done in design of source code. I
			will try to explain <i>what it is</i> and <i>why it is done this
			way</i>? Main goal was to clean and minimalize source code,
			remove several global variables, move everything concerned with
			help to these files.
		</p>
		<p>
			The help system is based on bi-directional list of help screens. 
			Each help screen has defined two variables, help text (<i>char
			*hlptxt</i>) and number of lines of help text (<i>int
			hlplns</i>).  Since this version the help file can/should be
			separated from *rc files. Advantage of this model is that you
			can set help to other languages. Usage of standard method
			(gettext) will be very difficult here, because help has constant
			width which can't be overcrossed. This method has also no
			problem with having several help files in each language (for
			joe, jmacs, ...). Problematics of setting proper help file will
			be solved in <i>main.c</i> not here.
		</p>
		<h3> How to create a help file </h3>
		<p>
			Help file consist of prologue, body and epilogue for each of the
			screens. Each help screen must begin with <i>{%name</i> where
			<i>%name</i> is only symbolic name of this screen and is not
			used in program. The body of help screen contains text which
			will be showed on the user screen and tags which takes care of
			special information (bold, flash, ...). There is list of the
			tags with theirs functions:
			<ul>
				<li> <b>\i</b> to turn on/off inverse video </li>
				<li> <b>\u</b> to turn on/off underline </li>
				<li> <b>\b</b> to turn on/off bold </li>
				<li> <b>\d</b> to turn on/off dim </li>
				<li> <b>\f</b> to turn on/off flash </li>
			</ul>
			These tags are inserted into help screen text, but they are not
			visible in the help screen (visible are only their effects, but this
			is their purpose <b>:)</b>)
		</p>
		<p>
			Some hints how to write a new help screen. Standard help screens have
			80 characters per line (including borders) so they are visible on text
			console. Sequences of keys are usually written as <i>^KD</i> where
			<i>^</i> means CTRL + next character <i>K</i> and then key named <i>D</i>
			should be pressed.
