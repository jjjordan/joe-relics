@- check for math functions

- Use *joerc if *fancyjoerc not there.

- update status line immediately on resize.

- va_copy fix.

- don't ever smartbackspace when smartbacks is off

JOE 3.7

- backspace/DEL means 'n' in replace prompt for better emacs
  compatibility

- Menus are now made up of macros instead of options.

	New commands:
		menu	Prompt for a menu to display with tab
			completion.

		mode	Prompt for an option to change with tab
			completion.

	Menus are defined in joerc file with :defmenu command.

	Menu entries are the pair: macro string.  String is a
	format string displayed in the menu.  Macro is executed
	when then menu entry is selected.

	Use this to add your own macros to ^T.

- ^T is now a user definable menu system

- Add Ukrainian .po file (yugk)

JOE 3.5

- Query windows now expand to multiple lines if necessary

- Single key queries are now internationalized (set local versions in the
  .po file)

- Spell check language can be set in the editor

- New syntax files: m4, joerc

- New debug window for highlight file syntax errors.

- Macros can be typed at the ESC X prompt (before it used to accept only
  commands).

- Built-in joerc file allows joe to run even if /etc/joe directory is
  missing.

- Support for 'long long' allows editing parts of files larger than 4GB. 
  For example, you can say: joe /dev/hda,0x100000000,0x1000 to edit the 4KB
  block at offset 4GB of a hard drive.

- Option which allows you set how many undo records to keep.

- You can give a path to the tags file in the TAGS environment variable.

JOE 3.4

- Paragraph reformatter and word wrap now handle '*' and '-' bullet lists.

- Better internationalization (i18n):

    JOE now uses gettext(), so that internal messages can be translated to
    the local language.  The /etc/joe directory now has a lang subdirectory
    for the .po files.

    Internationalized joerc files are now possible.  If LANG is en_GB, JOE
    tries successively to load joerc.en_GB, joerc.en and joerc.

- Multi-file search and replace:

    There are two new search and replace options:

      'a': the search covers all loaded buffers.  So you can say:

            joe *.c
            and then ^KF foo <return>
                     ra <return>
                     bar <return>
            to replace all instances of foo in all .c files.

      'e': the search covers all files in the error list.

            You can use grep-find to create a list of files:

            ESC g
             grep -n foo f*.c
            ^KF foo <return>
            re
            bar <return>

            You can also use 'ls' and 'find' instead of grep to
	    create the file list.

- JOE now restores cursor position in previously visited files.

- Build and grep window work more like Turbo-C: the messages window is
  forced onto the screen when you hit ^[ = and ^[ -.

- Syntax highlighter definition files (.jsf files) can now have subroutines. 
  This eases highlighter reuse: for example, Mason and PHP can share the HTML
  highlighter.

- I've changed the way JOE handles '-' and redirected input:

	joe < file		A shell process is started which 'cat's the
				file into the first buffer.

	tail -f log | joe	A shell process is started which 'cat's the
				output from 'tail -f' (watch a log file) into
				the first buffer.

	joe -			JOE does not try to read from stdin, but
				when the file is saved, it writes to stdout.

	echo "hi" | joe - | mail fred
				"hi" ends up in first buffer.  When you
				save, mail is sent.

- Many bugs have been fixed.  I've tried to address every issue in the bug
  tracker.  Hopefully I didn't create too many new ones :-)

- You can now define which characters can indent paragraphs.  Also the
  default list has been reduced so that formatting of TeX/LaTeX files works
  better.

- Highlighting now uses less CPU time and always parses from the beginning
  of the file (the number of sync lines option is deprecated).  Here is a
  CPU usage comparison for scrolling forwards and backwards through a 35K
  line C file:

	JOE	.58
	JED	.57
	NEDIT	3.26
	VIM	7.33
	EMACS	11.98

- JOE now matches Thomas Dickey's implementation of my xterm patch (but
  configure xterm with --paste64).

- File selection menu/completion-list is now above the prompt (which is more
  like bash).  Also it is transposed, so that it is sorted by columns
  instead of rows.

- "Bufed" (prompt for a buffer to edit), works like other file prompt
  commands: it's a real prompt with history and completion.

- Automatic horizontal left scroll jumps by 5-10 columns.

- New syntax files: troff, Haskell, Cadance SKILL, REXX, LUA, RUBY.  Many of
  the existing syntax files have been improved.

JOE 3.3

- The default background color can now be set.

- JOE now supports 256 color xterm.

- The mouse can now resize windows and select menu entries.

- During selection with the mouse, the window will autoscroll when you go
  past the edge.

- An xterm-patch is included which makes "-mouse" mode work better.  (With
  the patch, also set "-joexterm").

- Syntax files are provided: ADA, AWK, COBOL, SED, Postscript, and SQL

- Improved jpico: search now looks more like real pico

- Grep find: use ESC g to grep.  Then use ESC space to jump to
  to indicated file/line.

- Cygwin setup.exe support

JOE 3.2

- A Perforce SCM "p4 edit" macro has been supplied (along with the hooks
  within JOE which support it) so that when you make the first change to a
  read-only file, JOE runs "p4 edit".  (look in joerc file to enable the
  macro).

- Hex edit mode has been added.  For example: joe -hex /dev/hda,0,1024

- New '-break_links' option causes JOE to delete before writing files, to
  break hard links.  Useful for 'arch' SCM.

- JOE now has GNU-Emacs compatible file locks.  A symbolic link called
  .#name is created, "pointing" to "user@@machine.pid" whenever the buffer
  goes from unmodified to modified.  If the lock can't be created, the user
  is allowed to steal or ignore the lock, or cancel the edit.  The lock is
  deleted when buffer goes from modified to unmodified (or you close the
  file).

- JOE now periodically checks the file on the disk and gives a warning if
  it changed when you try to modify the buffer.  (JOE already performed this
  test on file save).

- The built-in calculator (ESC m) is now a full featured scientific
  calculator (I'm shooting for Casio Fx-4000 level here :-), including
  hexadecimal and ability to sum (and perform statistics on) a highlighted
  (possibly rectangular) block of numbers.  Hit ^K H at the math prompt for
  documentation.

- You can now change the current directory in JOE (well, it prompts with
  the latest used directory).

- Colors can now be specified in the joerc file

- Macro language now has conditionals and modifiers for dealing with
  repeat arguments.  Jmacs now works better due to this.

- Tab completion works at tags search prompt ^K ;

- ^G now jumps between word delimiters (begin..end in Verilog, #if #else
  #endif in C, /* .. */ and XML tags).  If it doesn't know the word, it
  starts a search with the word seeding the prompt.  It is also much smarter
  about skipping over comments and quoted matter.

- TAB completion is now much more like bash (again :-).  The cursor stays
  at the file name prompt instead of jumping into the menu system.  Also
  ^D brings up the menu, as in tcsh.  Also, tab completion now works on user
  names for ~ expansion.

- Now there is a ~/.joe_state file which stores:
	all history buffers
	current keyboard macros
	yank records

- Joe now has xterm mouse support: when enabled, the mouse can position
  the cursor and select blocks.  The mouse wheel will scroll the screen. 
  When enabled, shift-click emulates old xterm mouse behavior (cut &
  paste between applications).

- More syntax files: TeX, CSS, OCaml, Delphi, SML and 4GL.  Thanks to
  all of the contributers.

- Vastly improved highlighting of Perl and Shell due to the highlighter now
  understanding word and balanced delimiters.

- Many bugs have been fixed (every bug which has been entered into the
  sourceforge project page has been addressed).  Hopefully I didn't add
  too many new ones :-)

JOE 3.1

- Regex and incremental search (jmacs ^S) now work for UTF-8

- More and improved syntax highlighting files, including Mason

  it's not filled).

- Added -icase option for case insensitive search by default.

- Added -wrap option, which makes searches wrap

- Added status line sequence %x: shows current context (function
  name if you're editing C).

@Improve exit messages.

Improve 'lose' which is for jmacs.

Improve ^X for jpico.

Got rid of "end of processs" message in shell windows.

Shell windows can now be orphaned and duplicated (process
is associated with B instead of BW).

Shell window input taken from cmd.c instead of in
actual edit functions.

log
@joe a b c, now windows are in order a, b, c.

TAB completion now works on last path in prompt window:
for example '!ls foo', tab will complete the foo.

Added menu_explorer option.  When set: menu stays up when
a directory is seleted.  When clear: directory is added
to path and menu is closed.

Menus are now 40% of window size (or smaller if they are
not filled).

Cursor is now position after selected menu entry.
