@Clean up meaning of default color.

Allow syntax to be specified in joerc file: "-syntax perl"

Add class definitions to syntax files.

Add perl and verilog definitions (they need work).

Change joerc to assume files with . in their name do not want word
wrap enabled (except for .txt).

@# JOE syntax highlight file for C

# A (deterministic) state machine which performs lexical analysis of C.
# (This is the "assembly language" of syntax highlighting.  A separate
# program could be used to convert a regular expression NFA syntax into this
# format).

# Each state begins with ':<name> <color-name>'
# <color-name> is the color used for characters eaten by the state
# (really a symbol for a user definable color).

# The first state defined is the initial state.

# Within a state, define transitions (jumps) to other states.  Each
# jump has the form: <character-list> <target-state> [<option>s]

# There are two ways to specify <character-list>s, either * for any
# character not otherwise specified, or a literal list of characters within
# quotes (ranges and escape sequences allows).  When the next character
# matches any in the list, a jump to the target-state is taken and the
# character is eaten (we advance to the next character of the file to be
# colored).
#
# The * transition should be the first transition specified in the state.
#
# There are several options:
#   noeat     	do not eat the character, instead feed it to the next state
#             	(this tends to make the states smaller, but be careful: you
#		can make infinite loops).
#
#   recolor=-N	Recolor the past N characters with the color of the
#		target-state.  For example once /* is recognized as the
#		start of C comment, you want to color the /* with the C
#		comment color.
#
#   buffer    	start copying characters to a buffer, beginning with this
#		one (it's ok, to not terminate buffering with a matching
#		'strings' option- the buffer is limited to leading 19
#		characters).
#
#   strings	A list of strings follows.  If the buffer matches any of the
#		given strings, a jump to the target-state in the string list
#		is taken instead of the normal jump.
#
#   The format of the string list is:
#
#      "string"   <target-state>
#      "string"   <target-state>
#      done
#
# Weirdness: only states have colors, not transitions.  This means that you
# sometimes have to make dummy states with '* next-state noeat' just to get a
# color specification.
