 *
 * Get CAP entry for terminal named in 's'.  If 's' is zero, the name in
 * the environment variable 'TERM' is used instead.  Space for the returned
 * CAP is allocated from the heap using malloc.
 *
 * 'baud'   is the baud rate used for 'texec' to calculate number of pad chars
 * 'out'    is the function 'texec' uses to output characters
 * 'outptr' is the passed as the first arg to 'out'
 *          the second arg contains the char to output
 *
 * This is how 'getcap' finds the entry:  First a list of file names is
 * built.  If the environment variable 'TERMCAP' begins with a '/', it
 * is used as the list of file names.  Otherwise, if the environment
 * variable 'TERMPATH' is set, it is used as the list of file names.  If
 * that isn't set, then the string TERMPATH defined above is appended
 * to value of the 'HOME' environment variable, and that is used as the
 * list of names (a '/' is placed between the value of the environment
 * variable and the string).  If HOME isn't set, then TERMPATH alone is
 * used as the list of file names (without prepending a '/').
 *
 * Now the contents of the environment variable 'TERMCAP' (if it's defined and
 * if it doesn't begin with a '/') and the files from the above list are
 * scanned for the terminal name.  The contents of the environment variable
 * are scanned first, then the files are scanned in the order they appear in
 * the named list.
 *
 * If the last part of a matching termcap entry is a 'tc=filename', then
 * the current file is rewound and rescanned for the matching entry (and if
 * it's not found, the next entry in the file name list is searched).  If
 * a matching termcap entry in the TERMCAP environment variable ends with
 * a 'tc=filename', then all of the files in the name list are searched.
 *
 * There is no limit on the size of the termcap entries.  No checking is
 * done for self-refering 'tc=filename' links (so all of core will be
 * allocated if there are any).

@	Added -notite global option: when set, prevents screen from

	Added -usetabs global option: when set, uses tabs for cursor
	position update (which was the default before).  Now we don't
	use tabs by default.

        Completed change to 'unsigned char *' and elimination of
