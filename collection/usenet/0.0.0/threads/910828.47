When I installed "e" or "j" on my BBS, I called it "joe".  This is
easy to remember, and I think it's not too vain to call the editor
after the author.  In particular, my reason for doing this was the
subtitle: "I am Joe's Editor".  Anyone remember the old Reader's
Digest articles, where titles like "I am Joe's Heart" and "I am
Joe's Lungs" appeared?  Also, there was an alternative music group
for a while here called "I am Joe's Music".
