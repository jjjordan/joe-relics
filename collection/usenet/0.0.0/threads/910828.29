So much for my testing abilities... I work hard to test all these weird cases
and then only one day after posting the source someone finds a bug.  Oh well.

The Bug:  Running Undo or Redo before having done any deleting crashes the
editor

The fix:  Place the following lines in a file called 'patch0.0.1', change to
the directory containing the file 'j.c' and type this command:

	ed - j.c <patch0.0.1

--- Cut Here ---
/undo(/
+
a
if(!undorecs) return;
.
/redo(/
+
a
if(!undorecs) return;
.
/version/
s/0.0.0/0.0.1/
w
q
--- Cut Here ---

Then remake the editor.  The release number will be changed to 0.0.1

Also, feel free to change the name of the editor to 'JOE - Joe's Own Editor'
in case 'j' is already taken on your computer (if you have the language from
1989 or the editor from 1980).  This will be the name for the next complete
release of the editor, unless it to is taken :-)

Finally, feel free to change the name of 'keymap.j' file to '.joerc' in case
you like your initialization files hidden.  To do this, change the line

#define KEYMAP "keymap.j"

 to 

#define KEYMAP ".joerc"

This line can be found right at the beginning of the file j.h (remake the
editor after you do this).
