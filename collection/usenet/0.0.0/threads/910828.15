Randolph Carter (nee. Joseph H. Allen):
   Release 0.0.0 of 'J' (Joe's Editor):  This release supersedes all previous
   versions which lack a release number.  Note that this program was previously
   called 'E' but the name has been changed ('E' turns out to be one of the
   synonyms for 'vi').

You might want to think again.

'J' is a computer language.

You can ftp a copy from watserv1.waterloo.edu, directory 
languages/apl/j/
subdirectory by machine architecture.

It's been around since something like 1989...
