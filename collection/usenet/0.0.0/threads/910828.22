And before you think of going back to E, it happens to be the name of
"The RAND Editor", a full-screen editor that goes back to the
1970's...  The latter, by the way, is entirely public-domain; none of
this copyleft nonsense.

E used to be part of the MH distribution.  I think some folks at Purdue
have taken it over (it is now up to version 20 or so).  For folks who
just want a WYSIWYG editor for 7-bit ASCII ( :-) ), it is worth
considering.  You should be able to get it anywhere you can get MH
(alas, not here).
