My God, what a programme!
I found several things out:

humans are making mistakes
humans are making computers
computers are mistakes

I think the final conclusing should be:
computers are making mistakes

And don't you ever come to me and say it can't be a mistake of the
computer because it can!

What put me into this state?
Crashme version 1.4
My Sun 4/110 C crashed within 10 seconds!
Does this mean that I can bring even bigger mainfraimes down this way??
A horrifying idea, much more dangerous than the latest release of crack
(the password cracker I mean).
