Oh. So what is so bad about this program that should have been included
in *every* QA test suite of *every* release of unix?  So what is so
nasty about it?  One of the VMS sex fiends here at the U-C ran the
aforementioned code 'accidently' on one of the major production VMS
clusters with hundreds of users, during finals, instead of his own VAX-
station.  Nobody noticed.  (I don't think he meant to, I think he meant
to run it on his VAXstation.  I wish I had a penny for everything a 
programmer 'meant to do'.)


No wonder Paul says Unix is a toy.  And Unix is like his canoe, broke
but fun while he spent two weeks breaking it.
