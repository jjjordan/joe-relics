My apologies.  It was not my intention to insult the intelligence of anyone,
let alone the population of the entire European continent.  I was merely 
pointing out that *as written* the original posting was requesting source
code copyrighted by my employer.  Since the written word is the medium through
which we converse here, the motivations behind the written word can only
be inferred.  As the poster requested "SunOS" source, rather than 
SunOS-like source, the only assumption I could make was that the original
poster wanted someone to violate their source license agreement by providing
SunOS source code.  If, indeed, the poster wants only BSD/SunOS style source,
then this clarification is sufficient to cause me to apologize to both
you and the original poster.

Incidentally, and for the record:  My words are, of course, my own.  Sun
Microsystems, Inc. may or may not share my views. The mere fact of my
being an employee of that firm does not give any other significance to my
opinions.
