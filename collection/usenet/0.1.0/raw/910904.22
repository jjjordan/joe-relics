As I recall, the original poster was French. Therefore you should make
allowances for a certain imprecision of expression.

I am sure he meant to ask for the source to ** A ** login program for SunOS,
not the source to ** THE ** login program for SunOS, i.e. the proprietary
version owned by Sun Microsystems.

Very few people would be so stupid as to ask for proprietary source 
in a public forum. Even we Europeans have more sense.
