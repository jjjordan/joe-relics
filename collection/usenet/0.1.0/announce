Release 0.1.0 of JOE (Joe's Own Editor):  Note that this program was
previously called 'E' (which turned out to be the RAND EDITOR and one of the
synonyms for vi) and 'J' (which turned out to be a language and the name of
another UNIX editor).  See below for list of big fixes and new features. 
Find the source for this release in 'alt.sources'

FIXES AND NEW FEATURES FOR THIS VERSION

	* Left arrow jumping fixed

	* No longer touches the IXON IXOFF setting

	* Reference to Gnu EMACS removed from the copyright notice :-)

	* The patch for Undo and Redo is not needed for this version.

	* Name of initialization file changed to '.joerc'

	* Versions for ESIX and POSIX (AIX) now included
	  (thank you Mike Lijewski for the POSIX driver)

	* Users can now customize the help text.  The help text is now placed
	  in the initialization file

	* A compile option for passing characters with bit 7 set has been
	  added.  This is for Iceland

	* Added kill line function for the emacs people.  See 'killlin' in
          the .joerc file

	* The ioctls TIOCGSIZE and TIOCGWINSZ are used to get the
	  screen/window size.  If the window changes size, JOE resizes the
	  screen on the next key press

	* Prompts and messages wider than the screen width are now handled
	  properly

Introduction

	'JOE' is a small screen editor which was designed to be easy to use
for novice users but also to be powerful and complete enough for experienced
users.  Several elements of its design are unique innovations.  Here is a copy
of the on-line help text to give you a feel for this editor: 

GO TO              DELETE    MISC      BLOCK    FIND     QUOTE    WINDOW
^B left  ^F right ^D single ^T  mode   ^KB mark ^KF text `  Ctrl  ^KO split
^Z word  ^X word  ^W >word  ^R  retype ^KK end  ^L  next ^\ bit-7 ^KI 1 / all
^A edge  ^E edge  ^O word<  ^KA center ^KC copy ^KL line FILE     ^KP up
^P up    ^N down  ^J >line  ^KJ format ^KM move EXIT     ^KD save ^KN down
^U page  ^V page  ^Y line   ^KZ shell  ^KW save ^KX save ^KR read ^KG grow
^KU top ^KV end   ^K- undo  ^K, indnt< ^KY kill ^C abort/         ^KT shrink
^G matching ([<{` ^K+ redo  ^K. indnt>             close window  ^KE get file

Other relevent features:

	* Extremely small - the XENIX version is only 58K

	* Help text can be left on while editing

	* Key layout designed to eliminate headaches: ^Q and ^S are not used,
	  both ^H and DEL are backspace.  Also, each user may customize
	  his key layout by modifying a simple initialization file

	* Versions for BSD, HPUX, POSIX (AIX), ESIX and XENIX 386 are included
	  A simple driver is also provided to ease porting to other systems

	* Currently only VT100/ANSI terminals are supported.  If the terminal
	  has scrolling regions, JOE uses them.  Has well-tuned interruptable
	  screen update algorithm

	* Has: autoindent, word-wrap, overtype/insert, picture mode (right-
	  arrow makes space past ends of lines), right margin (for paragraph
	  formatting and center), and magic tabs (the column number of text
	  after tab stops is preserved when inserting and deleting)

	* The cursor column doesn't 'jump' when you move between long and
	  short lines.  Instead the cursor column only jumps when you try to
	  edit in an invalid place or if picture mode is set, the invalid
	  place is made real by space filling

	* Editor modes can be set depending on file extension

	* No line length restrictions.  Binary files can be edited without
	  difficulty

	* Long lines are truncated, not wrapped (I.E., the screen scrolls to
	  the right to get to the truncated parts)
