Here (well on alt.sources, anyway) is what I think (hope) will be the last
version of JOE before the rewrite (version 1.0.0).  This version includes
some quick fixes and additions to the previous one: 

	* undo/redo are now a real undo system instead of undelete

	* keyboard macros added

	* repeat prefix added

	* capture shell output and pipe block through shell command added

	* A version for Linux is now included

	* Simple macros may be specified in the .joerc file

	* Some bugs in the paragraph reformat routine were fixed

	* The right margin may be specified in the .joerc file

	* A bug where strange things would happen if you typed \ in the
          search & replace prompt is fixed

I have time now so I should be able to come out with the rewrite real-soon. 
Oh, and it looks like it will have a macro language.  It's going to be C
except that the C pointers will be buffer pointers.  This won't make it more
complicated to use- the only change I envision beyond what's in 0.1.2 is
that ^K L will be able to take vi-style regular expressions and editor
commands.
