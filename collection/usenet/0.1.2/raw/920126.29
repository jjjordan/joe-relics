I would like to know more about AMIX.  If it will indeed be a
marketplace, why charge callers (browsers) at all?  You get your
money when (if) they buy the software.  Egghead doesn't have
a door charge.

I have often wondered why no software (except shareware) is
distributed commercially by bbs.  It seems a natural.  Ask the
caller for his/her Visa, check the card and put him in a directory
containing the software.  When he downloads it, charge Visa.

Anyway, please tell me more about how AMIX will work.
