Archive-name: nntpbatch
Submitted-by: sjg@melb.bull.oz.au (Simon J. Gerraty)

This archive contains the XBATCH extention to NNTP and the
NNTPBATCH client that makes use of it.  NNTPBATCH was originally
developed by Frank Mayhar from nntpxmit by Erik Fair, Mel
Pleasant, et al.  The server mods are my fault :-)

XBATCH allows transfer of complete batches via NNTP.
The batches are not intererated by nntp in any way at all.  They
are simply received and enqueued for injection into news.

The aim is of course to be able to transfer compressed batches
via NNTP.  This is handy if you get the bulk of your news from a
single feed or if network bandwidth is of concern.

taureau.melb.bull.oz.au receives news from ladcgw.ladc.bull.com
(LA) via a NNTP.  The link at times is very slow and sometimes
unreliable.  At one stage we had to severely restrict the feed
to be able to transfer a days worth of news within 24 hours!
Using compressed batches via XBATCH, the same amount of news
is typically transferred in 2-3 hours.

The xbatch client software was originally developed by Frank
Mayhar <fmayhar@hermes.ladc.bull.com>, it has been enhanced with
a new driver script (in Bourne shell this time :-) that skips
trying a site if XBATCH permission has been denied.

The functionality provided by XBATCH will (hopefully) soon be
replaced by the BATCH command of the NNTP v2 specification.
XBATCH is simple to install and is dedicated to the Public
Domain in the hope it should prove a useful interim solution to
those with slow or unreliable IP links.

See README.XBATCH for more details about the NNTP changes.
See nntpbatch.1 for details of the client.
See INSTALL for further instructions.

Please report bugs/problems to me sjg@melb.bull.oz.au
