	I am looking for a X-based Postscript viewer with resizing
	capability (for exmple if you resize the window the picture
	would resize accordingly).  It would be nice if it is portable
	(no Motit/OpenLook/Xview calls). The usage that I have in mind
	is to take a background (corvert a pixmap, etc to PS) and
	display it. Any filters would aslo be nice (tiff->PS,
	pixmap->PS, etc) Could someone direct me to were I can find
	such a package?

	Please reply to ssa@aisg.com

	Thanks,
	S. Alavi
