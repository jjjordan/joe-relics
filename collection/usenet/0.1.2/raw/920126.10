Subject: tupact.tcl - 9X faster C-news active file "minimum article" updater
Message-ID: <1992Jan23.153548.10575@NeoSoft.com>

Below is a program for Extended Tcl 6.1a which updates the "minimum
article" field of the C-news system's "active" file.

As configured by the default distribution, it is never updated, which
causes users of many newsreaders to get the somewhat annoying
"4575 articles in group, read now? ... No articles." sort of messages
when reading groups they rarely get to.

A shell script called "upact" is included in /usr/lib/newsbin/expire
which will rewrite the active file, updating that field.  Some people
think it's a good idea to run at least once a week.

The shell script "tupact", included in the shar archive below, is totally
derived from "upact", and provides the locking functions and so forth,
but it then runs tcl to execute tupact.tcl rather than doing the actual
file updating itself.

In tests, tupact uses nine times less CPU time than upact (a whopping
28 times less "sys" CPU seconds) and runs in about a seventh the real
time, meaning it beats your disk for three minutes instead of twenty...
