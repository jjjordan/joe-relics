So, as usual, instead of e-mailing this person and saying not-nice-things, 
we're *all* treated to it. 

I could say practice what you preach, but let's not get into that. 

A while back I posted what could be generously called a trivial program to
try and re-capture the fondness I used to have for this group. Someone 
pointed out that System V had "tput" and someone else did a shell script
(neither of which would work in VMS :^))... 

Somebody post something! 

The only way to get discussion out of this group would be to moderate it
(like comp.sources). Like all the other groups, this one will get worse & 
worse. And I seriously doubt that belittling people publically is going 
to *HELP* anything!

I always use the modulus operator (% or MOD or ...) to get a 
number between 0 and N-1, and add one to it to get 1..N, because the 
remainder of the division will never be greater than N (or equal, else it 
would divide in another time). Go ahead and flame me all you like! You may 
need to stand in line, but that's life.(If you need a fraction, not an 
integer, you know how to divide by the base, and if you don't your computer
doesn't, you must be using COBOL.)

Since this is alt.sources, the source of a 1..N random number generator 
(when all C offers is rand(), which is a random number period) sounds like 
a valid question... 

Of course, comp.lang.whatever-language-he's-using might be better!
