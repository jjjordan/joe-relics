    (This is my first attempt at posting to alt.sources - hopefully I
got it right...)

	Have you ever wanted to have your .sig quote change from time to time?
    I did, and so I wrote the following two shell scripts, rsq (random 
    signature quote) and brn (bounded random number).  Obviously, by virtue of 
    the obscure names alone, these are for UNIX...
	"brn" is a semi-random number generator that can be given an argument
    limiting the maximum value generated (hence, bounded).  It uses the PID of
    the process as a "seed" to the generator (just a "mod" operation, really).
	"rsq" determines the number of quotes available from the .sig quote
    database, then uses this as the argument to brn.  The result returned by
    brn determines the quote that is copied from the database and appended to
    the bottom of the .sig "root" file (which contains all other information 
    but the quote).  This new file is then set up as the new .signature file.
    Customization is allowed by changing the values of numGen (the path to brn
    or some other bounded random number generator), sigDB (the path to the
    database of .sig file quotes), sigRoot (the pathname of the .sig "root" 
    file), and sigFile (the pathname of your .signature file).
	The .sig database is simply a text file containing all quotes you want
    as random quote candidates.  The quotes can span any number of lines, but 
    must begin with the "+=+" key string (but on the first line of the quote 
    only!).  For example, your quotes file might look like the following:

------- start of .sig quotes file ------------------------------>8 (cut here)
+=+Hi, I'm just a random .sig quote, who the hell are you?
+=+"If anything can go wrong, it will" -- Murphy's Law
 "Murphy was an optimist" -- Commentary on Murphy's Law
+=+One line of quotes is OK,
 Two lines is tolerable,
 Three lines is getting excessive,
 But I go for four!
+=+Jesus wept.
------- end of .sig quotes file -------------------------------->8 (cut here)

	...this file obviously contains 4 quotes, which will be randomly
    appended to the end of the .sig "root" file whenever rsq is run.  I have
    rsq set up in my crontab so that a new quote is generated every evening.
    It would also certainly be possible to set things up so that rsq ran every
    time you logged in, or you could just run it when you got tired of your
    current quote.  Have fun!

------- start of "brn" script ---------------------------------->8 (cut here)
#!/bin/sh
bound=$1
if [ "$bound" = "" ]
then
  # no bounds - return the PID...
  answer=$$
else
  # bound represents the upper bound of any answer given...
  answer=`expr $$ % $bound + 1`
fi
echo $answer
exit 0
------- end of "brn" script, start of "rsq" script ------------->8 (cut here)
#!/bin/sh
# User-definable options
numGen=${HOME}/bin/brn
sigDB=${HOME}/.sigDB
sigRoot=${HOME}/.sig_root
sigFile=${HOME}/.signature
# ...the actual code...
numsigs=`grep +=+ $sigDB | wc -l`
whichOne=`$numGen $numsigs`
cat $sigRoot > /tmp/$$.sig
awk " \
	/\+=\+/ { quoteNum++; } \
	{ \
	    if ( quoteNum == ${whichOne} ) \
		printit=1; \
	    else \
		printit=0; \
	    if (printit) \
		print; \
	} \
    " $sigDB | sed -e 's?+=+??' >> /tmp/$$.sig
mv /tmp/$$.sig $sigFile
exit 0
------- end of "rsq" script ------------------------------------>8 (cut here)
