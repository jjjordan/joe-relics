What exactly does this have to do with alt.sources? I don't know about
anybody else, but the list of newsgroups I have says that this is for
distribution of source code --not general discussions. It is SPECIALLY
not for advertising.

I also think it takes some serious gall to post an ad for a competitor
in this newsgroup --when this group does what it does with no special
charges beyond those associated with the feed.

I may be all alone, but I resent the hell out of your post.
