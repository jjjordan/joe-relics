long random(long N)
{
  long x;
  
  do
  {                    /*(1)   (2)*/
    x = random_upto_MAX() / (MAX/(N+1));
  }while(x >= N);

  return x;
}


The potential rounding error of the "/" below (1) is compensated for
by using N+1 instead of N. The probable rounding error below (2) makes the
net result potentially greater. All in all, what you get is evenly
distributed on 0..N-1, when it's in that range, but sometimes it is greater
than N-1, in which case you just try again. But this happens to rarely to
degrade performance.

Please be ware that it produces the N different values 0 .. N-1, but never
N itself. 

CODE IS NOT TESTED.

Hope this helps.
