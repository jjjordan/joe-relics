	following is a 4 part uuencoded shar posting of SoftList, a Perl
script.

	The idea is to have a locally available program that you
can use to keep track of what software packages are available, where
they are located, and who to contact about them.  I posted this idea
to comp.sources.d last October or so and got a lot of enthusiastic response.
I decided that an interactive script would be preferable to trying to
maintain such a list with an editor.  I've previously posted a SoftList
1.0 csh script prototype.

	The script handles records of the form:

package: ghostscript 2.3
contact: gnu.ghostscript.bug
location: prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu
GNU Postscript compatible interpreter

	I have included 25 or so records as a sample, so that you can get
a feel for what the script does.  I don't claim that they are up to date.
On that note, SoftList can output batches of records, and can read
batches (that may have been posted or emailed to you) to make new ones.
This provides an easy way for people to keep each other up to date,

	SoftList also includes a line editor with history for every input
field, and...SoftList gives you a Perl CLI where you can intersperse
Perl statements with Unix commands (via aliases).  I found this handy
for trying out bits of Perl!  You can also get at the variables of the
script, and use aliases (in your ~/.SoftListrc) to redefine many things
(and possibly call your own Perl scripts).   There is also a lot of online
help and a built in man page.

	A few sites have volunteered to be "master sites" for SoftList
records.  If you want to keep in touch with these, email:

	softlist-request@autodesk.com

	The idea is that combined with archie info, and information
from the comp.sources.unix server, there will arise a community of sites
that are pretty much in sync with what's out there, and people will be
able to save time in seeking out a package.  SoftList is an attempt
to cache such information at a local level.

	I'll be putting together a mailing list "softlist@autodesk.com"
in the near future.  I need to figure out the workings of mailing
list software first :-)

	I'll include the README after this, but first a quick note:

	I hint at a "MetaList" in the NOTES file, and I've actually
started on it.  The intent is to be able to handle SoftList data, but
also to be able define and use other types of lists (like an address list,
etc.) on the fly.  I'd like to see patches for SoftList (like getting the
local vs remote directory switching going), but I don't see it going
to a 3.0 level.  MetaList will replace it.

	Here's the README from SoftList:

        First distribution of Perl version.  SoftList 1.0 was a csh script.
 
        SoftList manages a "Current Versions of Software" list.  It's
a menu driven way of being able to look up answers to "what package is
available where?" questions.  It also includes a Perl command line
interpreter that you can issue Unix commands from, and lends itself
well to extension and customization.
 
        This contains everything needed to get started with SoftList.  I've
included some data files to try out lookups on.
 
        To get started, you could try pasting the following into a csh.
 
set verbose
mkdir -p ~/bin >& /dev/null
cp SoftList ~/bin
cp dotSoftListrc ~/.SoftListrc
cp -rp .softlist_files ~
unset verbose

        This directory contains:

                                of SoftList and MetaList
SoftList                        - Perl script
dotSoftListrc                   - copy to ~/.SoftListrc

        The man page to SoftList is sparse, and is included in the script
itself (Perl scripts allow you to tack the man page onto the end; you can
link the script to /usr/man/man1/SoftList.1).  There is a menu option in
SoftList to read it.  There are also several help screens.
 
Legal paragraph:
 
        Use and copy SoftList.  Please send me any modifications
that you make so that I may post official patches.  Don't say you wrote it.
I (and any company I work for) am not responsible for mishaps arising out
of the use of this program, on the other hand, I haven't run into any problems
with this.  Lastly, you may not use any part of SoftList in any product or
service for profit (electronic, paper, or any other media) without first
obtaining my written permission.
