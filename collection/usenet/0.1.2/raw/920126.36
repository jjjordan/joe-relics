NOOOOOOOO!  This is not a discussion group!! This is for posting sources.
We are NOT going to have another exponentially growing discussion on
random number generaters. LEARN TO POST CORRECTLY OR DON'T POST!!!!

BTW, Have you ever heard of integer division?? Huh? Does it ring a bell?
Don't waste our time. Learn to program before you post to thousands of
machines all over the world, costing the computer community hundreds of
dollars collectively. Read the damn manual, or ask someone with a brain.
