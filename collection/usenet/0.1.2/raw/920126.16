I am looking for a good way to transform numbers given by a random number
generator to a certain interval, let's say 0...N.

All random number generators that I know of produce numbers in the range
of 0 to MAX, where MAX is a very large number. If I used the simple
transformation
y = x * N;
result = y / MAX;
where x is the number produced by the generator, the real result of
x * N would not fit into a variable of the type (unsigned) long. So I am
not at all sure whether the random numbers would be equally distributed
in the range of 0...N using this transformation.

Alternatively, it is possible to use this transformation:
double y;
unsigned long result;
.
.
.
y = (double) x / MAX;
result = y * N;
But I would like to avoid using variables of the type double, as it would
slow down computation.

So does anyone have a good idea about what to do best? Rewriting a random
number generator where MAX equals N is not a solution for me, as I would
like to perform a different transformation on every number returned
by a generator.
