Lots of sites, including mine, use the "arbitron" program to
mail usage reports to the news lists people.  I never look at
individual .newsrc's (unless a user asks me to in order to debug
a problem), and couldn't care less what groups my users read (they
are here to be read, and I'm not interested in saying "nah nah, I 
found out you read XXX group").  I guess if I were to narrow down
my news feed from 2000 groups to 100, then I would have to pick
based on what people read.
