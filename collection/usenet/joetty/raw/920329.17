Such attitudes and the policies they promote (or the reverse) are sure
to be held by some but I hope a minority. This is certain to start two
threads of a debate, what is legal and what is ethical? At a very
minimum I would hope the systems you administer require new people to
sign a waiver of their right to privacy. If you are talking about
systems which people are required to use, such as instructional or
research computing at a university, I would find your policy
unacceptable and I would challenge it at every level of the campus
administration until I found someone who agreed with me. If it was a
requirement of employment, I would seek employment elsewhere.

To answer Scott, I know of local sites which require the system
support staff (and anyone else with privs) to sign a form saying they
will *not* use their privs to invade the privacy of an individual.
Sure, certain system problems require some files to be viewed. But to
claim people don't own the electronic bits and therefore do not have a
right to privacy is not acceptable in our large internet.
