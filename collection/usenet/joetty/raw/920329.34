Scott> Does anyone actually condone this invasion of privacy?

One of the jobs of a systems administrator (sysadmin) is to know what is
being done on the system they maintain. If you are not activly paying to
use a system, it is not an invasion of privacy for a sysadmin to look into
``your'' directories, for they do not belong to you, the disk space belongs
to whomever purchased the system, the same person or group who is paying
the sysadmin to maintain that system. The sysadmin doesn't even need to
justify looking into your filespace.

If, however, you *are* directly paying for the use of the system, such as
the pay-for-access ``Public Unix Systems,'' then you should expect some
privacy, and notification when someone else goes poking around in the space
you've rented. In this case, the sysadmin should have some reason for going
into your filespace (and it is yours, as long as you pay) and should notify
you when this is done. That's just common courtesey.
