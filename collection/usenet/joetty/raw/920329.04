  Today's arbitrary fondness would be for everyone to have their own, personal
crypter/compressor (crypt for their privacy, compress for smiles from their
disk-bound admins) so the question of forcing your admins to look at your files
would be moot.  I think some lawyer brains would kick in if they had to brute-
force their way into files using CBW, etc.  It would probably add other problems
but it's nothing that can't be done now with a little bit of effort.

  I don't think tuning your expire files to .newsrc contents is a good way to
do it, and I have reasons!  (:  Our site, for instance, has vast, silent hordes
of mac users via NNTP.  Also, if you trim your expire down so you don't carry
groups that nobody reads, what happens when someone tries to subscribe?  If
you have highly intelligent news gurus for readers, more power to you!  (:
Mine, statisticly, see zero articles and freak out and unsubscribe again.
(this happens to be based on experience gathered over the time it took me to
figure out I wasn't updating the min fields in my active file...  subscribe,
searches for a while and reports no articles.)

  The interests of the mac & !mac people at my site are diverse enough to make
any statistics I might gather via .newsrc files unrealistic, at best.

  Unfortunately, I have no constructive comments to make on how to deal with
reader voting.  I go on a request basis myself, and stay visible.
