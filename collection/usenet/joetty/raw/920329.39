A lot of BBS systems specifically post an unavoidable login message that
says something like "there is no such thing as a private message on this
system".  A pub acc unix site could do something similar if they felt so
inclined.

While it isn't appropriate to go rumaging through users files, it *is*
appropriate to keep close enough eye on things so you know what is happening
on your system.
