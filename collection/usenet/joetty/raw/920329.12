I agree that notification is a good idea.  However, there's still a
conflict between privacy and the ability to administer and tune the system.
And the need to do this in a for-pay system is as great as in a
noncommercial system (perhaps even greater, since paying customers may
expect more for their money).  If the site provides netnews, and it's faced
with the decision on whether to buy more disks for news storage (which
might result in rate increases) or drop its subscription to some groups, it
would be reasonable for it to do some investigation into which newsgroups
are actually read.  Scanning .newsrc files is a pretty good way to
determine this accurately.  An alternative is to mail out a survey, but you
just know that someone who was on vacation until the day after the deadline
(or just never got around to replying) will complain.

It's kind of difficult to be a proactive system administrator without
keeping an eye on what the users are doing with the system.  We need to
monitor how many users are running large programs so that we can adjust
memory management parameters or purchase more memory.  We need to find out
what programs are being used frequently so that we can be on the lookout
for new and improved versions.

I frequently run ps to look for users with lots of stopped processes, since
we have many users who don't understand the difference between Ctl-C and
Ctl-Z.  Am I helping them or invading their privacy when I do this and send
them a note explaining the correct way to use the system?
