Your employer has the right to do so on their privately owned
machines, of course, but at the very least they should (and should,
IMHO, be required to) make this policy very clear.

And, of course, you have the right to choose your employer.  (Yeah, I
know, there's a depression going on in the USA, but then, you don't have
``a right to work'' in this country.)
