One point the Wes doesn't bring up is that 'arbitron' doesn't even
give you a by-user breakdown, only totals.  (It doesn't even tell you
which users are reading news, and which are not.)  You have to
actively change the script to get username information.  In it's
unaltered form, arbitron is a very *useful* tool, as Wes described.
On the other hand, if an admin were to fish for any more information,
then that would be trespassing in private areas, and would, at least
here, be likely to result in stiff penalties or even loss of a job.
