Interestingly enough, there was a user here doing just that.  Since we
have a UUCP news feed, I try to limit the newsgroups to those that are
actually used.  My policy is "If you ask for it, I'll get it.  If it
isn't being read for several weeks, I'll drop it (especially if it's
high volume.)"  Based on arbitron reports, I found that a few groups
hadn't been read, so I dropped the feed for them.

Within a week, the user called up and wanted to know why the group no
longer existed.  The user described what they had been doing, and I
explained why that could result in a group being removed even though
it was being "read".  They then changed to reading it via trn so that
it would show up in my Arbitron report.  An explanation that I never
got told *who* was reading a group, just a count of users, was enough
for them.

I also run arbitron with root id, so the user was able to protect the
.newsrc against all non-root users.  That way they maintain total
privacy, and I get the information I need to periodically adjust the
news feed.  I never see the individual names, and would never attempt
to collect such information.  It is important for me to know the news
groups actually being read.  There are several other alternatives I can
think of, all of them worse for one reason or another:

        1)  Get a full news feed.
                Can't do this due to transfer and storage costs.

        2)  Drop the news feed entirely.
                Rather drastic, and would generally be unliked.

        3)  Ask users to periodically tell me what groups they
            are reading, and remove those that aren't being read.
                This is even worse than running arbitron, as it
                will collect the same information, in addition
                to the usernames.

        4)  Try to "guess" at an appropriate set of groups.
                If coupled with my policy of getting anything that
                is requested, this would work for awhile.  But
                eventually this would start incurring too much
                cost for newsgroups that nobody reads anymore.
                Case in point, over the last month I've trimmed
                down groups resulting in a weekly savings of
                about 10MB, which is non-trivial for us.


In short, I feel running arbitron is necessary to perform a reasonable
job of system administration.  If we could afford a full feed, I'd
say great and throw arbitron out the window.  But we can't, and so it
is a way to allow me to tune my system so that we can have a reasonable
news feed, yet still be able to use the system for work.
