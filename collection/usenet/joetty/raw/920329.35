I think we all agree that the information, when gathered, should be
kept confidential.  I think that Mr. McMahan is more concerned with
the actual gathering of the information.  I will attempt to address
that point.

When a site is running arbitron (or a similar script), they often use
the derived statistics to configure their news feed.  If, for example,
a site discovers that only one person (of, say, 1000 users) is reading
a particular newsgroup, they may decide to eliminate that newsgroup.
Of course, if *no one* is reading a particular newsgroup, the deletion
decision is that much easier.

If news becomes a problem in disk space consumption (and it often does!),
the "readership info" can help the news admin determine which groups are
widely read; the less frequently read groups would be candidates for de-
letion.

If you prevent your news admin from reading your .newsrc (through pro-
tection, renaming, compression, et cetera), you are effectively renoun-
cing your right to "vote" in the newsgroup maintenance process.  Pic-
ture, if you will, the following scenario:

	Newsadmin: Well, arbitron reports that no one is reading
		   alt.love.puppy, and it's getting somewhat large;
		   since no one is reading it, I'll delete it.

	(2 or 3 days pass....)

	    Users: Hey!  alt.love.puppy was my favorite group, and it's gone!

	Newsadmin: Well, why didn't your readership show up in the stats?

	    Users: Oh, we don't want you to know what we read, so we all
	 	   renamed/compressed/encrypted our .newsrc!

	Newsadmin: (Immediate and near-total loss of sympathy)

Most newsadmins try to serve their readers as much as possible.  Your
.newsrc (or its complement for ANU News/nn/trn/whatever) is your "voting
list" for the newsgroups you like.  Why give up your voice in the matter?

I agree that readership information for specific users should be kept
confidential.  I'll be the first one to lambaste any newsadmin who
starts generating or distributing "lists of alt.sex readers" (or the
like).  However, I maintain that there is a real need for scripts such
as arbitron; they are an extremely valuable tool in news site/feed
management.
