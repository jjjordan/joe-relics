While I agree that any individual news readership information should be
private, is it a great evil to collect statistics, erasing the individual
information?

Indeed, this is necessary if you are going to have on-demand subscription
in a system like dynafeed.

Yes, it means that people can then tell, "somebody at that site reads
alt.sex."  The only alternative is to get all alt groups so that nobody
can tell what you read.

Of course I can go into any small public library and find out some things
about the tastes of the community.  Is that bad?
