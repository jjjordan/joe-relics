First, I note that universities routinely recognize privacy rights
even within the university. For example, my university forbids itself
from making unreasonable searches of dorm rooms and assigned office
space.  They do this partly out of respect for academic freedom and
partly because the law requires it (esp. for state universities).

Second, I think there is a difference between university ownership of
the disks and university ownership of the information on the disks.
If a university owns all the information on its disks then it must
manage that information in accordance with the Family Education Rights
and Privacy Act (aka FERPA, aka Buckley Amendment). In many cases,
FERPA would make it illegal for a university to allow a user to look
at his or her "own" files. FERPA applies to virtually all
universities, even private ones.

Third, even though students seldom contract for computer resources,
they do have a general (and formal) contract with their university.
They are not charity cases; they are consumers.

None of this says that sys admin's can look at .newsrc files. But if
they can, it is not for the reasons you give.

to read, due process, and privacy) be applied to university computers
and networks? How are these principles actually being applied? How can
the principles of academic freedom as applied to computers and
networks be defended?
