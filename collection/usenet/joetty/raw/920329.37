On a VMS system that I sometimes read news on I have been known to do
	$ SHOW DEVICE/FILES DISK$NEWS:
(which shows all files currently open on that disk partition)
and get a nice listing of which article in which group is currently
being read by anyone using news or not.  I believe this is also
possible on most Unix systems.  I assume this can be disabled or
restricted but suspect it rarely is.

I really don't understand what stigma is to be associated with reading
or subscribing to alt.sex.* or any news group.  I don't pretend to
be a happilly wedded virgin and I don't see any problem with reading
any news group for the entertainment value or to keep up on what the
rest of the world is up to so you know what your teenagers are doing.

When I have anything particularly private on the computer I encrypt
it.  I have never assumed that anything I do on a computer will
remain private.  I think it would be nice if this would happen more
often but I've never had that expectation.

Computers are very good at making information accessible so there
are many too many accidental, intentional but well-meaining, and
malicious ways that information you put on a computer will fall into
unexpected hands.

I also periodically go around cleaning up disk space so our company
can continue to operate.  I feel no guilt looking around finding stuff
to delete even when that involves perusing directories and any files
in them that may no longer be needed.  However, I won't read files that
contain electronic mail or appear to be personal.

So I try to respect privacy without unduely hindering myself in
performing required tasks.  Maybe I should respect privacy more.
I certainly should set up some policy on what privacy users can
expect.  I try not to expect others to respect my computer privacy
even as much as I do theirs.

In a previous job I would track thwackers by reading their personal
mail.  Many misused accounts were found and disabled this way.  Prior
to that my entire group had their personal mail perused because the
administration feared us "student consultants" were likely to plant
back doors, etc.  It really didn't bother me.  There was no policy
in place about electronic privacy.  Anything I put on the computer
I interpreted as being posted on an out-of-the-way wall.  Not
publicly displayed but by no means private.

What is important is that the level of privacy matches the
expectations of those involved, IMHO.  Though, in many environments
a total lack of computer privacy is probably quite counter-
productive.

As for laws governing computer privacy...  Reminds me of the law
forbidding you to scan the cellular phone frequencies.  It's a nice
idea but mostly it just gives too many people a false sense of
security.  How many people do you know that have a radio scanner
that has either *not* been upgraded to avoid scanning these
frequencies or that the owner has *not* remodified it so it does
scan them?  How many of them have been arrested or are even
worried about ever being arrested?
