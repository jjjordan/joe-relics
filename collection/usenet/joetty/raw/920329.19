I may be a minority of one, but as was asked for, that is my OPINION. Not
as an administrator, but as someone who uses the machines at NU.
Personally, I'd rather have the admins here scan through everything rather
than have someone, say, cracking passwords and trying to break into my
account. It's an extreme example, I'll admit, but it is valid.

As to whether it's ethical or not is another matter entirely. Since I have
nothing to hide, I've nothing to complain about.
