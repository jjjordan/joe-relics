I have to apologize for not having new version of joe out as promissed.  The
deal is this:  I have other work to do and joe is taking a long time in any
case.  I'm still working on it though.  You may have seen the JOETTY thing I
posted to alt.sources a while ago.  It's done now (it happens that I'm using
it for my other work as well).  It's now got a new version of termcap which
allows you to have a sorted termcap file.  This allows termcap to be as fast
as terminfo (it uses a binary search to look up the termcap entry) but is
still compatible (upwards and downwards) with original termcap and more
importantly is as "open" as termcap (terminfo has a lot of problems in this
respect). 

Oh and that reminds me- should I include the GNU extensions to the termcap
language?  Does anyone actually use these extensions?  There's no way I'm
going to implement the terminfo language since it's incompatible.

Also the buffer management library is done.  It now uses a linked list of
gap buffers which can be swapped out to the disk.  The software virtual
memory system this uses has ended up being a real nice library in itself-
I've already used it for other things.  It implements three sets of access
functions: vopen/vclose/vtmp/vread/vwrite/vgetc/vputc/vseek/vtell/vgets/vputs,
the 'f' similer routines; vrb/vrw/vrl/vwb/vww/vwl, routines which make the
file look like an array; and vlock/vunlock/vchanged, routines which let you
access the buffered pages directly.  Joe's buffer management system uses
this last set so that any size files can be edited.  The other routines have
been useful for things which require a lot of seeking.  Any previously read
page is quickly accessed- it only requires a hash table lookup, not a 1K
transfer from the operating system.  This has been very helpful in the
database I've been writing (the work I'm getting paid for).

But there's still lots of work to go.  I have to make the window management
functions, the edit functions and the helper functons for them, the stuff to
handle prompts and their histories, the undo/redo transaction log, an
improved key binding system, the vi-like regual expression interpreter (for
the ^KL command), etc.  And I still don't know about an extension language.
This stuff is pretty easy though- it's just that there's a lot of it.  I'm
hoping that joe will be done before august.

The old version of joe is up to 0.1.5.  It has two things fixed:  the POSIX
driver now really works and joe doesn't loose a single character of typeahead
when you exit or shell-escape.  Get it from wpi.wpi.edu:stusrc/joe.tar.Z if
you didn't know.
