Hello Netters,
	I was wondering in anybody out there knows of an algorithm or a
shareware product that will convert PageMaker .pm4 files to any other
format such as tiff, gif, or pic.  I don't think PBMplus will do it
because .pm4 is a fairly new format (however, I'm too lazy to look).  I
need this because I have alot of slides produced with Pagemaker that I
need to make a slideshow presentation out of and PageMaker doesn't do
any format exchanges.  So if anybody could give me a good kick in the
right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.

Gracias.

Jeff Horn
