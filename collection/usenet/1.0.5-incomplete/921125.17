Here's a little hack that grew out of a conversation Brad Morrison
(brad@neosoft.com) and I have been having off and on for a few years,
namely, whether or not people would feel more guilty about screwing off 
at work if you paid them in cash a couple of times a day.

Barring that, you can simulate it with the Tk script, countpay, below.
It shows elapsed time and how much money you've made since you started it.
You'll need Extended Tcl time and date functions.  (Tcl, Tk and Extended Tcl
are available from sprite.berkeley.edu and barkley.berkeley.edu)

#
# countpay - cute hack that shows how much you're making over time to help
# you feel guilty and stop screwing off, or whatever.  Requires Extended Tcl.
#
# usage: wish -f countpay dollars_per_hour
# where dollars per hour is a floating point value.
#
# It could be made to be a lot more efficient, but this way it's nice & short.

proc countpay {widget timeAtStart hourlyRate} {
    after 1000 countpay $widget $timeAtStart $hourlyRate
    set secondsElapsed [expr {[getclock] - $timeAtStart}]

    set days [expr {$secondsElapsed / 86400}]
    set hours [expr {($secondsElapsed % 86400) / 3600}]
    set minutes [expr {($secondsElapsed % 3600) / 60}]
    set seconds [expr {$secondsElapsed % 60}]

    set pay [expr {($hourlyRate * $secondsElapsed) / 3600.0 + 0.005}]

    .time configure -text [format "%3d:%02d:%02d:%02d $%.2f" $days $hours $minutes $seconds $pay]
}

if !$interactiveSession {
    if {[llength $argv] != 1} {
        puts stderr {usage: 'countpay 50.00' to count pay at $50/hour.}
        exit 1
    }
    countpay .time [getclock] $argv
}
