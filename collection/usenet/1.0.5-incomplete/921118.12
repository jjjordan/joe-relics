This is version 0.0 of the code to allow mountable DOS filesystems
under 386bsd 0.1.  It is refered to as pcfs from now on.  No, this is
not related to sun's pcfs, although they essentially do the same
thing.

This package has been installed on a 386bsd 0.1 system that has NOT
had the patchkit installed.  But, pcfs only changes a few files in
the base system so if pcfs changes collide with the patchkit they will
be small and localized.

Unshar each of the following 4 shar files.  They create files in
/sys/pcfs and /usr/src/sbin/mount_pcfs.  They do not overwrite any
existing files.  Once you have them unshared read the /sys/pcfs/INSTALL
file to find out how to install it and mount pc filesystems.  Then look
at the /sys/pcfs/pcfs.8 file for a list of the filesystem's quirks.

If you have problems send me some email and I'll see what I can do.
If you add things please send me the mods and I will try to incorporate
them for the next release.

Have fun,
Paul
