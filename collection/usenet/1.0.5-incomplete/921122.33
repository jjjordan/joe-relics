[Lot's of stuff and source deleted.]

But MS-Dos has got Perl. Here's my Perl variant of the same program:

perl -ne 's/^\s+//; @c=split; print $c[2] . " " . sqrt($c[0]^2+$c[1]^2)' in.dat

I make these kind of filters all of the time to do coordinate
transformations in my research.

Why reinvent the wheel when the wheel is a swiss motor chain-saw?
