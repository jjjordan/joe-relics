                     XmFm - An X11/Motif File Manager


Description:
	xmfm is a file manager that shows files as icons in panes.
	It divides the display of a directory into three areas,
	executable files, directories and ordinary files to distinguish
	between them.  When a file is selected a range of actions can
	be performed on it. This is configurable on a per user basis.
	xmfm also allows arbitrary programs to be run from within it.
