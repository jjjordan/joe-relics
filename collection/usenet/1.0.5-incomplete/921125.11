Education is, of course, the best solution. But sometimes you need to
kill everything a single user is running, or whatever. This script
grew from a small function one of NU's sysmonsters wrote for bash, I
turned it into a nicer shell script, and was further cleaned up by
another NU sysmonster. One nice feature is that it won't try to kill
itself while it's trying to kill something else.

-----begin "thwap" script-----
#!/bin/sh

# Kills all processes with a certain string in them.

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
  echo "usage: $0 [-signal] user|process [user|process ...]"
  exit 1

case $1 in
  -* )
    sig="-1"
    shift
    ;;
  * )
    sig="-9"
esac

for proc in $@ ; do
  for pid in `ps auxw | grep -v awk | awk "/$proc/{print \\$2}"`; do
    if [ $pid -ne $$ ]; then
      echo kill $sig $pid
      kill $sig $pid
    fi
  done
done
